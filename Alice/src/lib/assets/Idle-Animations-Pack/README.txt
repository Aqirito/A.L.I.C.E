
I do not care what you do with these motions and poses - use them for absolutely anything you would like, video games included. I just have three rules.

Rules:

- Do not redistribute the ORIGINAL motions or poses without my written permission
- You can only redistribute EDITED versions of these motions and poses
- CREDIT ME (deedee524)

Have fun! :)

NOTES:

- The mermay animation is not perfect, specifically in the tail area. This will need some work by the downloader, but works otherwise.
- There is a glitch with the "swaying" idle animation. The model blinks while their eyes are closed in a smile. 
- The "hat flip" idle animation NEEDS to be fixed. I have no idea how to fix it, so the downloader will need to fix the animation if they decide to use it. 
One potential fix is to use a .x file ("accessory") in place of the hat I used, which was a part of the model, and put this accessory replacement somewhere
on a hand bone (like dummy_R). 
- Perhaps it is just the model, but the "shy" idle animation seems a bit robotic, but maybe it has to do with the model I used. The motion MIGHT need to be 
fixed by the downloader to look smoother.
